title: Interaction Design, not UI Design
---

Interaction Design is about *behavior*: how the system or application
interacts with the user. Usually people think of a typical graphical
windowed interface, such as you might see on a personal computer or a
portable device, as being the thing being designed. Almost the entire
focus of interaction design tends to be on this user interface.

But that is too limited a view, particularly when considering embedded
systems.

Besides a graphical interface, application output could include
simpler visual indicators like lights (LEDs), including combinations
of colored lights that can blink in a pattern or show animations. Also
common are extremely limited LCD or LED panels that can show (for
example) only a few text characters and/or a few predefined elements
that can be on or off.

But beyond visual output, two other senses are also usable:

* Sounds: beeps, chirps, alarms, and more complex synthesized output
  including musical notes and spoken words.
  
* Touch, through vibration of an element that is held in the hand or
  is otherwise next to the user's skin.

* More complex haptic feedback through special-purpose devices worn on
  the hand.

Similarly, there is a wide variety of methods by which the user can
provide inputs to the application through sensors. Mobile phones
already contain gyroscopes and accelerometers; industrial equipment
can reuse a wide variety of sensors that were originally developed for
sensing phenomena in the real world. For example, a motion sensor can
detect when someone crosses a threshold to a door, so that this user
action becomes an input to the application.

Interaction design must include all of these methods of input and
output.
